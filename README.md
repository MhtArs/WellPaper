# WellPaper
WellPaper is a simple Android app to show awesome photos from [Flickr REST API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/). App was inspired a lot from [Mike Penz](https://github.com/mikepenz)'s [Wallsplash](https://github.com/mikepenz/wallsplash-android/) which uses Unsplash and other platforms as image source.

#Download
The app will be published soon on Google Play.
